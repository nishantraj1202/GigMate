## 🧗‍♂️ Challenges We Ran Into

- **Complex Navigation with React Navigation v6**: We had to spend extra time managing nested layouts and dynamic tabs. We resolved this with modular routing and customized navigation containers.
- **Voice Integration for Low Literacy Users**: Integrating smooth voice assistance was tricky; we used native modules and speech libraries to improve reliability.
- **Real-time Updates & Security**: Migrating from Firebase to MongoDB required major changes to authentication and syncing logic, which we overcame by restructuring the backend to support real-time communication and end-to-end encryption.
- **UI Optimization**: Making the interface intuitive for first-time smartphone users led us to adopt Neo-brutalism UI principles — bold, clear, and minimal.
